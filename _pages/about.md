Kelin Li is a Doctorate candidate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where he is co-supervised by [Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/p.kormushev) and [Prof. Rafael A. Calvo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.calvo). Currently, he is working in [Robot Intelligence Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/) led by [Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/p.kormushev). He used to work in [REDS Lab - Robotic manipulation: Engineering, Design, and Science (REDS Lab)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/reds-lab) led by [Dr. Nicolas Rojas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.rojas). Prior to joining Imperial College, he received an M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China, in 2019, and a B.S. degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation at [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/), Changsha, China, in 2016.

His research interests mainly include **Visual Grasping** and **Imitation Learning** in Dexterous Robotic Hands. Particularly, he is interested in implementing VR and learning algorithms that empower dexterous robotic hands to see and think more intelligently. He has developed strong skills in **Reinforcement Learning** and **Computer Vision**. In addition to scientific research, he loves travel, musical and sports, especially football!

Please feel free to contact should you be interested in his research.
